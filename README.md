# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python — Learning Repository

This repository documents my step-by-step journey learning Python from scratch using the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".

The goal is not just to read the book, but to fully understand Python by building small, complete, and practical projects for every chapter.

---

## Learning Goals
- Learn Python fundamentals from absolute zero
- Understand every line of code written
- Build clean, minimal, and correct Python programs
- Develop good GitHub and project structure habits early
- Progress toward real-world automation and data-related tasks

---

## Repository Structure
Each chapter has its own dedicated folder:

chapterXX_topic_name/
├─ README.md        # Chapter explanation and goals
├─ src/
│  └─ main.py       # Chapter project source code
├─ .gitignore

---

## Study Method
For every chapter:
1. Study the core concepts
2. Build a small project demonstrating those concepts
3. Keep code simple and readable
4. Upload the result with clear documentation

No shortcuts. No copy-paste without understanding.
