# Chapter 02 - Flow Control

## Description

This project demonstrates the fundamental flow control concepts from Chapter 02 of "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python". It includes a simple number guessing game that uses conditionals, loops, and user input validation.

## Concepts Covered

- Boolean values and operators
- Comparison operators
- if, elif, and else statements
- while loops
- break and continue statements
- for loops and range() function
- Input validation

## Project: Number Guessing Game

A simple interactive game where the user tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. The program provides hints and tracks the number of attempts.

## Features

- Input validation to ensure valid guesses
- Hint system (higher/lower)
- Attempt counter
- Option to play again

## How to Run

### Windows Command Prompt

cd chapter02_flow_control
python src/main.py

### PyCharm

1. Open the project folder in PyCharm
2. Right-click on src/main.py
3. Select "Run 'main'"

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding boolean logic and comparisons
- Using conditional statements for decision making
- Implementing loops for repetitive tasks
- Breaking out of loops when needed
- Validating user input
- Creating simple interactive programs

## Notes

This is a beginner-level project focused on flow control fundamentals. The code is intentionally simple and uses basic constructs to reinforce Chapter 02 concepts.
