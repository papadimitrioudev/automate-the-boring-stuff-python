# This program demonstrates basic Python concepts:
# print(), input(), variables, and simple string output.

# Ask the user for their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Ask the user for their age
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Display a summary message
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("You are " + age + " years old.")
